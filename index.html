          <p > Hi, I’m Kasey McCormick, a designer, developer, and learner.  I’m enamored with following an idea from conception to execution and with every step in between.</p>
    
          <p>I obtained my Bachelor’s of Studio Arts in Graphic Design and a minor in Marketing from University of Nebraska at Omaha. I earned a development certificate from Omaha Code School, where I learned full stack development, and learned Design Thinking facilitation from IBM’s training. I have always enjoyed learning new skills and pick them up in various ways. I’m passionate about making experiences better in the digital or analog world. When I’m not on my computer creating I’m often outside or painting while listening to audio books or podcasts.</p>

          <h2>Maker Club</h2>
          <h4>Founder</h4>
          <p>Maker Club is an after school program at Springville Elementary. I started it in 2016 after my Mom who works at Springville informed me that the school had a 3D printer but no resources to teach it. I worked on a proposal of learning goals for the club and lesson plans for principal and district approval. The Club lasts for thirteen weeks and meets for forty-five minutes weekly. Where kids learn about coding, and 3d printing and design. </p>

            <p>Noticing that all emails sent by the University were plain text and did not include the logo, I created templates for the Grad School.  Four department templates were created that include a logo header, body copy with variations of image placement, buttons, and a footer. It's now being adapted to undergrad emails this year.</p>

          <h4>Creighton University</h4>
          <p>After seeing what I could accomplish with emails, the writers on my team asked for a newsletter template. To be used for the Doctorate of Education in Interdisciplinary Leadership program communication flow, as students take up to two years to decide and commit. There are four sections to the email, and it's cross client compatible. This template has been modified and used for two other communication flows as well. </p>

              <h4>Creighton University</h4>
              <p>The Grad School website hadn't been updated in about four years. Tasked with redesign but also progressive enhancements I found pages that could benefit the most with upgrades. As navigation changes were put on hold. I worked with the analytics specialist to identify high traffic pages noted by Google and Slate, our student applicant tracker. Then created a priority list of pages to update, and collaborated with the two writers on content and new layout options. I kept to University Communication's standards but also improved usability through organization of content. In the case of Speak with an Enrollment Specialist page, pictured at left, pictures of recruiters were added, directions were consolidated to two concise lines and a Google map was embedded.</p>

            <h2>Site Enhancements</h2>
            <h4>Creighton University</h4>
            <p><b>Improved Program Navigation</b><br/>The table on each subdomain would make a user travel back to www.creighton.edu, or stay within www.creighton.edu which is highly undergrad focused. Now when a user selects a grad program they are sent to the grad school subdomain. The same goes for business programs.</p>
            <p><b>Conditional Request Form Buttons</b><br/>A program page has a button called request for information, but there are three request information forms created by the university. An overall one, a Heider College of Business one and a Grad one. I created javascript code to detect the subdomain and send them to the correct RFI. Instead of a user being on gradschool.creighton.edu and clicking on a business program then being directed to Heider request information form. When they may not of been introduced who or what Heider is.</p>
            <p><b>Linking to an Open Accordion</b><br/>University Communication team often uses accordions on the website. Our team wanted to link to an open one in an email communication, but the feature wasn't available. I created code, that could be added to the page for this to happen, and how-to's so other teams could use it as well.</p>

              <p>From my point of view, MMD was a huge success. We had a good turnout, the audience was great, the pros were enthusiastic and presented killer material, the venue was amazing, and everything went off without a hitch, really— especially with it being two years since the last event. I was at that one, and for my money, this one was a big improvement.

              <h2>Me Myself and Design</h2>
              <h4>Event Chair - AIGA Nebraska</h4>
              <p>After being away for almost two years AIGA Nebraska sought out to bring back Me, Myself, and Design MMD a student focused design conference, to it's yearly programming. I was voted on to organize and execute the event for 2016. The limitations I was given were: that it had to be in Lincoln, Nebraska, 45 minutes away from where I reside, or halfway in between Omaha and Lincoln.Additionally the budget was set at $1200.00 already. With the experience of not only attending MMD in prior years but also previously residing on the board, I set a handful of my own goals to help direct my decision making. They were as follows:
                </p>
              <ul class="project__content__list">
                <li><b>Diverse speakers –</b> haven't spoken for AIGA Nebraska before, broad range of subjects, range in experience, gender, and other demographics.</li>
                <li><b> Diverse attendees – </b>University and community College students, different years in schooling, and other other demographics.
                </li>
                <li><b>Inclusive food choices –</b> providing a variety of choices for attendees throughout the day</li>
                <li><b>No additional costs –</b> the ticket to cover attendees needs for the day, including parking.</li>
                <li><b>Reusable Logo –</b> years prior recreated a logo and accompanying materials each year, taking a lot of time and resources. I wanted to have a logo that could/would be used year after year and alleviate that pain point.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> Each goal was met, with the additional accomplishments of securing the location and food under budget. Obtaining 10 portfolio reviewers from local agencies. Having three keynote speakers and 10 additional panel speakers throughout the day. As well as providing art direction for all materials and mentoring the co-chair for when they lead the following year.</p>
